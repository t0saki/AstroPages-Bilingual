## Hello, world! Welcome to my blog! This is a bilingual space I built using Astro. Why did you start this blog? In this era of information fragmentation, I want to have a corner of my own to sink my knowledge and feelings about life. Through the bilingual format, I also hope to communicate with more friends from different cultural backgrounds. What will I share here? In the coming days, I plan to update the following content: Technical notes: front-end development, Astro framework tips and programming techniques. Tool Recommendations: I'll share the best tools to improve work efficiency. Reflections on life: thoughts on reading, traveling, and daily life. How to contact me? If you have any thoughts about my articles, or just want to say hi, feel free to send me an email via the email icon at the bottom of the page! Thank you for reading and I hope we can grow together in the written word.
